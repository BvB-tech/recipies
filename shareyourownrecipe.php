            Foodgawker

When you think of food-sharing sites, Foodgawker probably first comes to mind. It’s one of many “gawker” websites (Weddinggawker is another example of a post aggregate site!), but Foodgawker is where you’ll want to submit your recipes.

Foodgawker needs to accept your recipe before they actually post it, and they review each photo to make sure that the food looks appealing, that the white balance looks natural, and that the composition is tempting. You can read more about Foodgawker’s criteria and submission guidelines here.

We like Foodgawker because content creators submit links to their recipes, rather than the full recipes themselves. This means that if a Foodgawker user wants your recipe, they’ll need to go to your site to get it.

Pro Tip: When you submit your recipes to Foodgawker, make sure you include an enticing description to help encourage clicks through to your site! Your description will be shown directly under your photo on Foodgawker’s feed.
